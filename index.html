                      <span class="intro">I joined the Centreville studio in March of 2011, and as I said in class so many times, it was one of the best things I ever did for myself.</span>
                      <span class="more"> When I joined, I was, for many reasons, overwhelmed with anxiety and knew I needed guidance to get back on a path to peace and happiness. Dahn Yoga practices and Yun were my answers. Yun is one of the most genuine and humble persons I know. He takes the time to know each member and understand their concerns in order to better help them with their journey to become stronger physically, mentally and emotionally.
                        After a short while of attending classes, I started feeling like a "new" person, couldn't wait to go to class and learned how to incorporate what I learned in class to help me deal with my stress on a daily basis. Remembering to breathe...REALLY breathe was key for me.
                        All of the instructors are so great, bringing their own individuality and energy to each class. At the end of each, I always felt stronger and energized physically and refreshed and calmer mentally. So, if you're looking for a nonjudgmental friendly place to become physically stronger and better deal with stress and anxiety, Body and Brain in Centreville is the place for you. You won't regret it. Sarah Carty, Centreville</span>

                        <span class="more"> Here you will find the teachings of Dahn yoga, which is a unique practice in the way that it combines yogic postures with a mixture of tai-chi, breathwork, rhythmic dancing, and meditation. The emphasis is ultimately on training your brain to operate at different frequencies and using it to heal the body. There is a real sense of community among the members that attend regularly, all of whom know each other by name. For me, the Body & Brain center has become a source of motivation to make myself and my life better each day through even the smallest actions. Master Yun is a humble teacher who gives himself fully to each student, often spending time speaking with them one-on-one about their own progress. Words can't really describe how much it means to be surrounded by people who are determined to heal their lives. Whether you are looking for a journey inside of yourself, or to simply release the stress and tension of everyday life, the opportunity is there waiting at Body & Brain. Kristen Jenkins,VA </span>
